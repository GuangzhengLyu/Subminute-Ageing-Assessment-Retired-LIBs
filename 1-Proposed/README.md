# 1-Proposed
## Subminute Cross-Dimensional Ageing Assessment (Core Implementation)

This folder contains the full implementation of the proposed ageing assessment framework described in the main manuscript (**Fig. 1 to Fig. 5**). It includes deep-ageing observation, pulse-inspection relaxation voltage analysis, internal-state feature extraction, multi-task PLSR modelling, and visualization of assessment results.
