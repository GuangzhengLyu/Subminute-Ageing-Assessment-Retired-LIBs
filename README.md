# Subminute-Ageing-Assessment-Retired-LIBs
MATLAB implementation of subminute cross-dimensional ageing assessment for retired lithium-ion batteries using pulse-inspection relaxation voltage (PIRV) and RC internal states. Supports multi-task prediction (SOH, RUL and four expanded indicators), sorting-consistency evaluation, and validation on 10 open-source datasets.
