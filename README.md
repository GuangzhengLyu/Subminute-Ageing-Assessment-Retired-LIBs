# Subminute-Ageing-Assessment-Retired-LIBs

This repository accompanies the manuscript:

“Subminute diagnostics reveal hidden heterogeneity of deep ageing patterns beyond capacity for second-life lithium-ion batteries”  

and its Supplementary Information.

This work addresses rapid and cross-dimensional ageing assessment of retired lithium-ion batteries under consecutive retirements and deep ageing conditions. A three-year ageing dataset is reported, covering:

- 590 samples  
- 119,691 cycles  
- Over 3.25 billion time-series entries  

across unexpected, normal, and secondary retirement scenarios.

Beyond capacity, four service-relevant performance indicators are analysed:

- Energy efficiency  
- Constant-current charge rate  
- Mid-point voltage  
- Platform discharge capacity  

A subminute assessment framework is developed using pulse-inspection relaxation voltage and a second-order RC equivalent circuit model. Six internal-state features extracted from 30 seconds of relaxation voltage data enable joint assessment of:

- SOH  
- RUL  
- Expanded SOH indicators  

via partial least squares regression.

All code and processed data required to reproduce the reported results are provided in this repository.

- Ageing trajectory (cycle index)  
- Expanded performance indicators  

These datasets serve as the base input for all subsequent modules.
